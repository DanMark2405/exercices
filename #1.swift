## Expressions, Variables & Constants Challenges

### Challenge 1
 Declare a constant `exercises` with value 9 and a variable `exercisesSolved` with value 0. Increment this variable every time you solve an exercise (including this one).
 */
var exercises = 9
var exercisesSolved = 0
exercises+=1
exercisesSolved+=1
/*:
### Challenge 
 Given the following code:
 ```swift
 age = 16
 print(age)
 age = 30
 print(age)
 ```
  Declare `age` so that it compiles.  Did you use `var` or `let`?
*/
var age:Int
 age = 16
print(age)
 age = 30
print(age)

/*:
### Challenge 3
 Consider the following code:

```swift
let a: Int = 46
let b: Int = 10
```
 Work out what `answer` equals when you add the following lines of code:
```swift
// 1
let answer1: Int = (a * 100) + b
// 2
let answer2: Int = (a * 100) + (b * 100)
// 3
let answer3: Int = (a * 100) + (b / 10)
```
*/
let a: Int = 46
let b: Int = 10
let answer1:Int = (a * 100) + b//4610
let answer2: Int = (a * 100) + (b * 100)//5600
let answer3: Int = (a * 100) + (b / 10)//4601


/*:
### Challenge 4
 Add parentheses to the following calculation. The parentheses should show the order in which the operations are performed and should not alter the result of the calculation.
 */

/*:
 Solution:
 */
let Result = (5 * 3) - ((4 / 2) * 2)
/*:
### Challenge 5
 Declare two constants `x` and `y` of type `Double` and assign both a value. Calculate the average of `x` and `y` and store the result in a constant named `average`.
 */
let x=1.568
let y=34.00568
let average = (x+y)/2
/*:
### Challenge 6
 A temperature expressed in ¬∞C can be converted to ¬∞F by multiplying by 1.8 then incrementing by 32. In this exercise, you will do the reverse: convert a temperature from ¬∞F to ¬∞C.
 
 Declare a constant named `fahrenheit` of type `Double` and assign it a value. Calculate the corresponding temperature in ¬∞C and store the result in a constant named `celcius`.
 */
let fahrenheit:Double = 230
let celcius = (fahrenheit-32)/1.8

/*:
### Challenge 7
 Suppose the squares on a chessboard are numbered left to right, top to bottom, with 0 being the top-left square and 63 being the bottom-right square. Rows are numbered top to bottom, 0 to 7. Columns are numbered left to right, 0 to 7.
 
 Declare a constant `position` and assign it a value between 0 and 63. Calculate the corresponding row and column numbers and store the results in constants named `row` and `column`.
 */
let position = 24
let row:Int = position/8
let column:Int = position/8



/*:
 ### Challenge 8
 A circle is made up of 2ùúã radians, corresponding with 360 degrees. Declare a constant `degrees` of type `Double` and assign it an initial value. Calculate the corresponding angle in radians and store the result in a constant named `radians`.
 */
let degrees:Double = 3456
let pi = 3.14
let radians = degrees/pi

/*:
### Challenge 9
 Declare four constants named `x1`, `y1`, `x2` and `y2` of type `Double`. These constants represent the 2-dimensional coordinates of two points. Calculate the distance between these two points and store the result in a constant named `distance`.
 */
 let x1:Double = 3,x2:Double = 45,y1:Double = 34,y2:Double = 4
 let distance = sqrt(pow((x2-x1),2)+pow((y2-y1),2))
